## Licence Tracker Prototype
This is a simple **ASP.NET Core** application which simply retrieves a portfolio of licences available to an individual software developer.

It's a throwaway application but is my strating point to developer a full blown licence portal for software developers. The portal application code will also double as a best practice guide to structuring monolothic .NET applications. Well that'e tha ambition at least.

This is the starting point and I'm following Nate Barbettini's excellent The Little ASP.NET core book. https://recaffeinate.co/about/
